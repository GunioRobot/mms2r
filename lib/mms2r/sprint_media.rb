  ##
  # Sprint version of MMS2R::Media
  #
  # Sprint is an annoying carrier because they think they
  # are so important that they don't actually transmit
  # user generated content (like images or videos) directly 
  # in the MMS message.  Instead, what they do is hijack the 
  # media that is sent from the cellular subscriber and place 
  # that content on a content server.  In place of the media 
  # the recipient receives a HTML part telling the recipient 
  # how great Sprint is with links back to their content server.
  # Then the recipient has to click through Sprint more pages 
  # to view the content.
  #
  # The default subject on these messages from the
  # carrier is "You have new Picture Mail!"

  class MMS2R::SprintMedia < MMS2R::Media

    ##
    # MMS2R::SprintMedia has to override process() because Sprint
    # doesn't attach media (images, video, etc.) to its MMS.  Media such
    # as images and videos are hosted on a Sprint content server. 
    # MMS2R::SprintMedia has to pick apart an HTML attachment to find
    # the URL to the media on Sprint's content server and download
    # each piece of content.  Any text message part of the MMS 
    # if it exists is embedded in the html.
