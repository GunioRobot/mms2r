Version 2.4.1 of MMS2R is the last TMail based MMS2R.  TMail
http://tmail.rubyforge.org/ has been deemed to be a legacy gem and the most
RFC compliant Ruby gem for everything email related is now Mail
http://github.com/mikel/mail .  I may back-port configuration settings to the
old MMS2R code base which will live in the legacy_tmail_branch branch and
publish point releases for 2.4.X.  But I may not so don't count on it.  Version
3.0.0 of MMS2R will be the master branch going forward and will be dependent on
the Mail gem.
Thank you
Mike
